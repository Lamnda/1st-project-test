  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p> Hello! I'm a 25-year-old master's student in Mechanical Engineering with a passion
    for technology and innovation. Throughout my academic journey, I've specialized in designing
    and developing robotic systems, honing my skills in CAD software, particularly SolidWorks.
    My expertise lies in creating intricate and precise designs that push the boundaries of what's possible.
    Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by taking courses in front-end development. My goal is to merge my
    engineering background with my newfound love for coding, aiming for a career in the dynamic field of web 
    development. I'm excited about the potential to create visually stunning, user-friendly web interfaces that
    enhance user experiences.
    I'm enthusiastic about applying my diverse skill set to new challenges and am eager to contribute to innovative
    projects. Whether in mechanical design or web development, I'm committed to delivering excellence and creativity.
    Let's connect and explore the possibilities of working together!</p>
